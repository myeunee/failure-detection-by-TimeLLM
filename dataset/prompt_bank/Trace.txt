This dataset contains multivariate, sequential data for all compute instances executed on a single machine (ID 91960537867) from the Google Cluster Traces, recorded during May 2019. The data is structured as a collection of independent time series. Each individual instance is uniquely identified by the composite key of collection_id and instance_index. These instances are sequentially connected to form the complete operational history of the machine. Each data point represents a measurement window, which is typically 5 minutes (300s) long, though the duration may be shorter if an instance starts or stops within that period. The dataset is designed for a multi-task, time-series forecasting problem. The objective is to predict two target variables for the next time step are avg_usage_memory (a continuous, regression task) and fail_in_window (a binary classification task). Key features (covariates) are provided for this task, including engineered features that represent the instance's context, such as elapsed_time_seconds (representing the total runtime since the instance started), resource_request_memory (the allocated memory limit), and past_failure_count (the instance's historical instability).
